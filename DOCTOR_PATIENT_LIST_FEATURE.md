# Doctor Patient List Feature

This document describes the new "My Patients" feature added to the doctor dashboard, which displays a doctor's patients and their confirmed appointment history in a tabbed table format.

The feature provides doctors with a comprehensive view of their patients and confirmed appointment history in a tabbed interface:

1. **Patient List Tab**: Shows all patients who have confirmed appointments with the doctor
2. **Appointment List Tab**: Shows all confirmed appointments for the doctor's patients

## Files Modified

1. [src/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx](file:///Users/pino/Documents/live/company/doc/src/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx) - Added import and tab content
2. [src/components/patient/PatientListWithAppointments.tsx](file:///Users/pino/Documents/live/company/doc/src/components/patient/PatientListWithAppointments.tsx) - Updated component to fetch real data
3. [DOCTOR_PATIENT_LIST_FEATURE.md](file:///Users/pino/Documents/live/company/doc/DOCTOR_PATIENT_LIST_FEATURE.md) - This documentation file

## Integration with Existing System

The component integrates with the existing API endpoints:
