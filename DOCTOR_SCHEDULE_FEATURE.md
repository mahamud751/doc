# Doctor Schedule Feature

This document describes the updates made to the doctor dashboard schedule feature to display real data instead of mock data.

## Overview

The doctor schedule feature in the doctor dashboard has been updated to fetch and display real schedule data from the database instead of using mock data. The schedule now shows the doctor's actual recurring availability slots grouped by day of the week.

## Files Modified

1. [src/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx](file:///Users/pino/Documents/live/company/doc/src/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx) - Updated to fetch and display real schedule data

## Implementation Details

### Data Fetching

- Uses the existing `/api/admin/doctors/schedule` endpoint to fetch doctor availability slots
- Filters for recurring slots only (is_recurring = true)
- Groups slots by day of the week
- Displays time slots in a user-friendly format (e.g., "09:00 AM - 12:00 PM")

### UI Components

- Replaced mock schedule data with real data from the API
- Maintains the same visual design and layout
- Shows "Closed" for days with no availability slots
- Includes loading and error states

### Data Processing

- Fetches schedule data when the schedule tab is active
- Processes availability slots to group by day of week
- Converts time formats to user-friendly display format
- Handles edge cases like days with no slots

## API Integration

The feature integrates with the existing API endpoints:

1. Fetches data from `/api/admin/doctors/schedule?doctor_id={id}`
2. Uses the existing authentication system
3. Follows the same data structures as the rest of the application

## Usage

To view the schedule:

1. Log in as a doctor
2. Navigate to the doctor dashboard (`/doctor/dashboard`)
3. Click on the "Schedule" tab in the sidebar
4. View the weekly schedule with actual availability slots

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future development:

1. Add ability to edit schedule directly from the dashboard
2. Include non-recurring slots in the display
3. Add date-specific scheduling information
4. Include appointment bookings within the schedule display
5. Add color-coding for busy vs. available time slots
