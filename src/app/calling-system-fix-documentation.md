# Video Calling System Fix Documentation

## Problem Analysis

The original issue was: **Patient can call doctor but doctor cannot see any incoming call UI or notification.**

### Root Cause Identified

The patient and doctor dashboards were using `joinVideoCall()` which only opens a video call page without notifying the target user, instead of using `initiateVideoCall()` which properly uses the calling service to send real-time notifications.

### Technical Details

1. **Patient Dashboard Issue**: The "Join Call" button only used `joinVideoCall()` to open a video page
2. **Doctor Dashboard Issue**: The "Start Call" button only used direct video page navigation
3. **Missing Notification Flow**: Neither dashboard used `callingService.initiateCall()` to notify the other party
4. **GlobalIncomingCallHandler**: Was correctly mounted but couldn't show incoming calls if they weren't being initiated properly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Patient Dashboard (`/src/app/patient/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Added:**

- Import for `callingService`, `ActiveCall`, and `OutgoingCallIndicator`
- New state for `outgoingCall`
- `initiateVideoCall()` function that uses `callingService.initiateCall()`
- `handleCancelOutgoingCall()` function
- Updated "Join Call" button to use `initiateVideoCall()` instead of `joinVideoCall()`
- Added `OutgoingCallIndicator` component to show call status

**Key Changes:**

```typescript
// NEW: Proper call initiation that notifies doctor
const initiateVideoCall = async (appointment: Appointment) => {
  const call = await callingService.initiateCall(
    {
      calleeId: appointment.doctor.id,
      calleeName: `Dr. ${appointment.doctor.name}`,
      appointmentId: appointment.id,
      channelName: channelName,
    },
    patientId,
    patientName
  );
  setOutgoingCall(call);
};

// UPDATED: Button now initiates call instead of just joining
<Button onClick={() => initiateVideoCall(appointment)}>Call Doctor</Button>;
```

### 2. Fixed Doctor Dashboard (`/src/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Added:**

- Import for `callingService`, `ActiveCall`, and `OutgoingCallIndicator`
- New state for `outgoingCall`
- `initiateVideoCall()` function that uses `callingService.initiateCall()`
- `handleCancelOutgoingCall()` function
- Updated both "Start Call" and "Call Next Patient" buttons
- Added `OutgoingCallIndicator` component to show call status

**Key Changes:**

```typescript
// NEW: Proper call initiation that notifies patient
const initiateVideoCall = async (appointment: Appointment) => {
  const call = await callingService.initiateCall(
    {
      calleeId: appointment.patient.id,
      calleeName: appointment.patient.name,
      appointmentId: appointment.id,
      channelName: channelName,
    },
    doctorId,
    doctorName
  );
  setOutgoingCall(call);
};

// UPDATED: Buttons now initiate calls instead of just opening video pages
<Button onClick={() => initiateVideoCall(appointment)}>Call Patient</Button>;
```

### 3. Real-time System Verification

**Confirmed Working:**

- HTTP polling-based real-time communication (1.5 second intervals)
- Event routing via `/api/events/emit` and `/api/events/poll`
- GlobalIncomingCallHandler properly mounted in root layout
- Calling service event listeners properly set up
- Socket client properly connecting and authenticating users

## Testing

### Test Page Created: `/test-dashboard-calling`

A comprehensive test page was created to verify the fix:

- Simulates both doctor and patient modes
- Tests bidirectional calling
- Shows real-time event logs
- Verifies incoming call notifications appear immediately

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Patient Dashboard Flow:**

   - Patient clicks "Call Doctor" on appointment
   - `initiateVideoCall()` sends real-time notification to doctor
   - Doctor immediately sees incoming call modal via GlobalIncomingCallHandler
   - Doctor can accept/reject the call
   - If accepted, both parties join video call

2. **Doctor Dashboard Flow:**
   - Doctor clicks "Call Patient" on appointment
   - `initiateVideoCall()` sends real-time notification to patient
   - Patient immediately sees incoming call modal via GlobalIncomingCallHandler
   - Patient can accept/reject the call
   - If accepted, both parties join video call

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ **Compilation**: No TypeScript errors
2. ✅ **Real-time System**: Active polling and event routing
3. ✅ **GlobalIncomingCallHandler**: Properly mounted and listening
4. ✅ **Calling Service**: Event listeners configured correctly
5. ✅ **UI Components**: OutgoingCallIndicator and IncomingCallModal available

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/patient/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added proper call initiation
2. `/src/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added proper call initiation
3. `/src/app/test-dashboard-calling/page.tsx` - Test page created

## Key Technical Components Used

1. **CallingService**: Handles call initiation, acceptance, rejection
2. **SocketClient**: HTTP polling-based real-time communication
3. **GlobalIncomingCallHandler**: Global component that shows incoming calls
4. **IncomingCallModal**: UI for incoming call notifications
5. **OutgoingCallIndicator**: UI for outgoing call status

## Result

The video calling system now provides **bidirectional real-time call notifications** between patient and doctor dashboards. When either party initiates a call, the other party immediately receives a visual notification and can accept or reject the call.
