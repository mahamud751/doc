# Agora Video Call Fix Instructions

## Problem Summary

You're experiencing an "invalid vendor key" error when trying to initialize video calls, even though your App ID appears to have the correct format (32 characters).

## Root Cause

This error typically occurs when Agora's servers don't recognize your App ID, which can happen for several reasons:

1. The Agora project is not properly configured or has been suspended
2. The App ID belongs to a different Agora account
3. The project has billing issues or policy violations

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Verify Current Configuration

1. Visit the debug page: http://localhost:3000/agora-debug
2. Run all tests to confirm the issue

### Step 2: Create a New Agora Project (Recommended Fix)

1. Go to [Agora Dashboard](https://console.agora.io/)
2. Sign in with your Agora account
3. In the left sidebar, click "Projects"
4. Click the "Create Project" button
5. Choose "App ID + App Certificate (Recommended)"
6. Give your project a name (e.g., "MediConnect Video Calls")
7. Click "Create"

### Step 3: Update Your Environment Variables

1. Copy the new App ID and App Certificate from your Agora dashboard
2. Update your `.env` file with the new credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=your_new_32_char_app_id_here
AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=your_new_32_char_certificate_here
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Step 5: Test the Video Call

1. Go to your patient dashboard
2. Schedule or join a video call appointment
3. The error should now be resolved

## Alternative Solutions (If the above doesn't work)

### Check Project Settings

1. In Agora Dashboard, select your project
2. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Basic Information"
3. Ensure "Video SDK" is enabled
4. Check that the project status is "Active"

### Verify App ID Ownership

1. Make sure you're logged into the correct Agora account
2. Verify that the App ID belongs to your account and not copied from another source

### Check for Billing Issues

1. Go to "Billing" in the Agora Dashboard
2. Ensure your account is in good standing
3. Check if there are any payment issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "invalid vendor key" persists after creating new project
