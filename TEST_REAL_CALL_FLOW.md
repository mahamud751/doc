# üîß Real Call System Testing - URGENT FIX NEEDED

## Current Issue

The calling system isn't working because:

1. **GlobalIncomingCallHandler shows "Still loading user info"** - localStorage not being read
2. **Real user ID**: `cmga1c7tz000diqeefhlwx57c` (DOCTOR)
3. **Socket system**: Working in mock mode but not connecting to real user IDs
4. **No real-time notifications**: When patient calls doctor, doctor doesn't see anything

## Quick Fix Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Current State

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/debug-call-system`

This page will show:

- ‚úÖ/‚ùå User Authentication status
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Socket connection status
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Current user context
- Real-time logs

### Step 2: Expected Results

For a logged-in doctor (ID: `cmga1c7tz000diqeefhlwx57c`):

- ‚úÖ User Authentication: Should show "Dr. Name (DOCTOR)"
- ‚úÖ Socket Connection: Should show "connected"
- ‚úÖ User Context: Should show the real user ID
- ‚úÖ Mock Mode: Should show "Active"

### Step 3: Test Call Flow

1. Open `/debug-call-system` in two browser tabs
2. Tab 1: Should show current doctor info
3. Tab 2: Login as a different user (patient)
4. Tab 1: Enter patient user ID and click "Test Call"
5. Tab 2: Should show "Incoming call" notification

## If Issues Found:

### Issue A: "Still loading user info"

**Problem**: localStorage not accessible or empty
**Fix**: Check if you're logged in properly

### Issue B: Socket shows "disconnected"

**Problem**: Socket not connecting with real user ID
**Fix**: Click "Reconnect Socket" button

### Issue C: No incoming call notifications

**Problem**: Mock event bus not routing to correct user ID
**Fix**: Use exact user IDs from localStorage

## Expected Behavior After Fix:

- Doctor refreshes page ‚Üí Socket connects automatically
- Patient calls doctor ‚Üí Doctor sees immediate notification
- Doctor can accept/reject calls in real-time
- Video call opens with proper parameters

## Test URLs:

1. **Debug Page**: `/debug-call-system`
2. **Test Page**: `/test-video-call-system`
3. **Doctor Dashboard**: `/doctor/dashboard`
4. **Patient Dashboard**: `/patient/dashboard`

The debug page will give us real-time visibility into what's happening!
