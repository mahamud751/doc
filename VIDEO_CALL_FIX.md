# Video Call System Fix

This fix addresses the issues with the video call system where:

1. Incoming calls were not properly showing on the receiver's side
2. Call acceptance/rejection was not working correctly
3. The calling system was not properly routing calls to the intended recipients

## Key Fixes Made

### 1. GlobalIncomingCallHandler.tsx

- Fixed the socket connection to properly update when userId changes
- Ensured incoming call detection works correctly by adding proper dependencies to useEffect
- Improved logging to help with debugging

### 2. socket-client.ts

- Fixed the mock event bus routing to properly direct calls to the correct user
- Improved subscription management when userId changes
- Enhanced event routing logic for call-related events

### 3. calling-service.ts

- Fixed the acceptCall and rejectCall methods to properly identify caller/callee
- Improved call response handling
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

### 4. IncomingCallModal.tsx

- Improved call response handling in the modal
- Fixed the joinVideoCall function to properly route users to the correct video call pages

## How to Test the Fix

1. Open two browser windows or tabs
2. In each window, navigate to `/test-video-call-fix`
3. In Window 1:
   - Set User ID to "user1"
   - Set Your Name to "User One"
   - Click "Set User Info"
   - Click "Connect Socket"
4. In Window 2:
   - Set User ID to "user2"
   - Set Your Name to "User Two"
   - Click "Set User Info"
   - Click "Connect Socket"
5. In Window 1:
   - Set Target User ID to "user2"
   - Set Target Name to "User Two"
   - Click "Call Target User"
6. In Window 2:
   - You should now see an incoming call modal
   - Click "Accept Call" to connect or "Reject Call" to decline

The call should now properly route between users and the video call should work correctly.
